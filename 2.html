  <h1>chinese Grammar</h1>
<p>The grammar of Standard Chinese or Mandarin shares many features with other varieties of Chinese. The language almost entirely lacks inflection, so that words typically have only one grammatical form. Categories such as number (singular or plural) and verb tense are frequently not expressed by any grammatical means, although there are several particles that serve to express verbal aspect, and to some extent mood.</p>
<p>The basic word order is subject–verb–object (SVO), as in English. Otherwise, Chinese is chiefly a head-final language,[citation needed] meaning that modifiers precede the words they modify – in a noun phrase, for example, the head noun comes last, and all modifiers, including relative clauses, come in front of it. This phenomenon is more typically found in SOV languages like Turkish and Japanese. </p>
<p>Chinese frequently uses serial verb constructions[missing example], which involve two or more verbs or verb phrases in sequence. Chinese prepositions behave similarly to serialized verbs in some respects,[a] and they are often referred to as coverbs. There are also location markers, placed after a noun, and hence often called postpositions; these are often used in combination with a coverb. Predicate adjectives are normally used without a copular verb ("to be"), and can thus be regarded as a type of verb.</p>
<p>As in many east Asian languages, classifiers or measure words are required when using numerals—and sometimes other words such as demonstratives—with nouns. There are many different classifiers in the language, and each countable noun generally has a particular classifier associated with it. Informally, however, it is often acceptable to use the general classifier ge (simplified Chinese: 个; traditional Chinese: 個) in place of other specific classifiers.</p>
